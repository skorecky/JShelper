### About
This allows you to get some rails style helpers in your JavaScript projects. There are currently only a few to start with but I plan on adding more over time.

Demo: http://skorecky.github.com/JShelper/

### Testing
The helper.js file is tested with qUinit and you can see the test suite at http://skorecky.github.com/JShelper/test/

This file is also regurally tested at http://jshint.com

### How to Use
Simply download this repo locally and include helper.js in your html file before anything that calls it. It's written in pure JavaScript so it should work nicely with any JS Framework / Library.
